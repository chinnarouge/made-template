#understand the overlaying problem of how weather affects the air travel

Air travel is mainly based on weather data and all the hurdles will be solved once we will be able to manage our itinerary according to the current weather forecasts,Traveling has become a part of life and most of our day-to-day activities are hugely dependent on traveling, Air travel is a pervasive norm and more than 30 million people use air transport in a single day. Weather is one of the most important features that affect any
transport, so we need to know how much impact it causes on a whole. In this project, for the analysis, we have taken Munich city weather data and people flying
from the Munich airport from 2000 to 2023. We try to find the correlation between the number of passengers traveling from Munich airport with respect to the weather
